## How to declare a variable

There are some rules and guidelines that need to follow when declaring a variable name.

					1. Variable name should be meaningfull.
					2. Cannot contains special characters like !, @, #, $, % and spaces.
					3. First character of a variable name must be a alphabetic letter 
                          or _ .

Every variable has a data type. Python assigns relevant data type to the variable automatically. Therefore we don't need to include the data type when declaring a variable. Also, variables in Python is case-sensitive.
